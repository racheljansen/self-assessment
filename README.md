Rational Bayesian model of Self-Assessment

Dunning-Kruger project:

The Dunning-Kruger folder contains code for generating basic version of the model and Dunning-Kruger version (with and without a guessing parameter), along with analyses associated with data located on OSF (https://osf.io/er9ms/). This is presented in a paper titled "A rational model of the Dunning-Kruger effect supports insensitivity to evidence in low-performers" in Nature Human Behaviour (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01057-0).

Confidence project:
In contrast to the previous work which models a groups of participants' judgments made about their performance after a task, this project involves modeling each participant individually over time by asking for periodic judgments.
